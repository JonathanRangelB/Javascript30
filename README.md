Wes Bos Javascript challenge, 30 projects, 30 days, tons of fun

source page for this challenge is this https://javascript30.com/

It started all because of the syntax podcast the Wes Bos has on Spotify.

I was curious about his job and projects and I saw this challenge, after that I decided to accept the challenge to improve my unpolished skills on web development
